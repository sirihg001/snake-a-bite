## Introduction

The Snake Game AI project aims to teach an AI agent how to play the Snake Game by applying reinforcement learning techniques. The agent uses a deep Q-network to make decisions, and the training progress can be visualized in real-time.

Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Training Script:


## run it
bash
Copy code
## python agent.py 
This will start the training process, and you can observe the training progress in the console.

## Visualization:

The training progress is dynamically visualized using the helper.plot function. Check the console for real-time plots of scores and mean scores.
Results:

The training results, including score progression and mean scores, will be displayed in the console.
Project Structure

**`agent.py`**: Contains the implementation of the reinforcement learning agent.

**`game.py**`: Implements the SnakeGameAI environment.

**`model.py**`: Defines the Q-network and QTrainer classes for neural network training.

**`helper.py**`: Provides a function for real-time visualization of training progress.

**`requirements.txt**`: Lists project dependencies.

## Training and Results

The training process involves iterative gameplay, with the agent learning to navigate the Snake Game environment.
Scores, mean scores, and visualizations are displayed during and after training.

## Next Steps

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different parameter values for optimal training efficiency.

Algorithm Exploration: Consider exploring alternative reinforcement learning algorithms.

Neural Network Enhancements: Investigate advanced architectures for improved learning.
